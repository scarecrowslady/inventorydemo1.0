  title: "A History of Sumarene\t"
  content: Herein lies the tale of King Corvanon, who, upon his twentieth winter,
    did lay hand on the Crown of Aberanth. Against the will of the Fates did he attempt
    to wrest that power, and so was he laid low and corrupted. For fifteen years,
    his reign dragged the land of Sumarene into madness and despair. Until, one day,
    a fair maiden brought a vial of Blessed Water and did cleanse that corruption.
